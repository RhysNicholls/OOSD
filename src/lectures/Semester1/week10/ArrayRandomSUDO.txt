Create an  array of 100 random numbers between 10 and 110. 
Filter out any duplicate numbers. 
From this we could create 2 arrays â€“ oddNumber and evenNumber. How? 

VARS
int [] allInts = new int[100]
int [] noDupsTemp = new int[100]
int [] noDups
int count = 0

LOOP for i 0 to < 100
  SET allInts[i] to random number  0 -1000
ENDLOOP

LOOP for i 0 to < 100
 IF noDupsTemp NOT contains allInts[i] // METHOD
   SET noDupsTemp[count] = allInts[i]
   SET count++
 ENDIF
ENDLOOP

INITIALIZE noDups to size count

LOOP  for i to < count
  SET noDups[i] = noDupsTemp[i]
ENDLOOP
===================================================
METHOD boolean contains(int i , int [] noDups, int count)

LOOP j from 0 to < count
  IF noDupsTemp[j] = i
    RETURN true
  ENDIF
ENDLOOP

RETURN false
