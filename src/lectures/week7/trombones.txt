76 trombones led the big parade
With a 110 cornets close at hand.
They were followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuosos,
The cream of ev'ry famous band.

76 trombones caught the morning sun,
With a 110 cornets right behind.
There were more than a 1000 reeds springing up like weeds,
There were horns of ev'ry shape and kind.

There were copper bottom tympani in horse platoons,
Thundering, thundering, all along the way.
Double bell euphoniums and big bassoons,
Each bassoon having his big fat say.
There were 50 mounted cannon in the battery,
Thundering, thundering, louder than before.
Clarinets of eve'ry size and trumpeters who'd improvise
A full octave higher than the score.

76 trombones led the big parade,
When the order to march rang out loud and clear.
Starting off with a big bang bong on a Chinese gong,
By a big bang bonger at the rear.

76 trombones hit the counter point,
While a 110 cornets played the air.
Then I modestly took my place as the 1 and only bass,
And I oompahed up and down the square.
