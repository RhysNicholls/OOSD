How can we find and total the integers in a file when they are 
mixed in with words?
E.g see "trombones.txt" 
=====================================================

Scanner scan =  .... getResource trombones.txt 
int total = 0 (must set to 0 so we can add to it!)

LOOP while input file has tokens
   IF next token is an integer
     READ integer and add to total
   ELSE
     READ word/token
   ENDIF
ENDLOOP

PRINT total
